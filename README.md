# JARVIS --Initiated
# Jarvis: GUI

JARVIS The Jarvis project is a chatbot application that uses C++ programming language, system design, and high-level data structures and algorithms to provide solutions to user's queries. It is similar to the ChatGPT model in terms of providing conversational responses to user inputs, but instead of relying on machine learning algorithms, it utilizes the power of C++ programming language.

The system design of the Jarvis project involves a modular approach with well-defined interfaces between different modules. The main modules include the input module, response module, knowledge module, and output module. The input module takes user inputs and passes it to the response module. The response module utilizes high-level data structures and algorithms to analyze the user input and provide a suitable response. The knowledge module maintains a database of relevant information that can be used to provide responses to user queries. The output module formats the response and displays it to the user.

The Jarvis project utilizes high-level data structures and algorithms such as hash maps, linked lists, trees, and sorting algorithms to provide efficient solutions to user queries. It also implements advanced search algorithms such as the A* search algorithm to provide accurate and relevant responses.
